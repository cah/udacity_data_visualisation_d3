#####Dataset columns:
name      : Players Name 
handedness: Left Handed, Right Handed, or Both (Switch Hitter)
height    : Player Height 
weight    : Player Weight 
avg       : Batting Average 
HR        : Number of Homeruns

###Design:

This chart should provide the reader the ability to see the relationship between homeruns, weight, and handedness. After reviewing the dimplejs API, I selected a stack barchart to encode the data. Next, I shared the visualization with several readers. Based on the readers feedback, several enhancements were indentified. Those enhancements are documented in the feedback section. 


###Feedback:
1. Version One Feedback
  1. Chart Needs Title
  2. Needs title cleanup on x
  3. Needs title cleanup on y
  4. Weight on x axis is too busy
  5. Consider moving legend 

2. Version Two Feedback
  1. Legend needs title
  2. Would be helpful to filter on handedness

3. Version Three Feedback
  1. No additional suggestions were received. Chart was clear.
